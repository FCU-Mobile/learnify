# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Learnify** is a gamified learning system consisting of:
- **Frontend**: macOS native app built with Swift/SwiftUI 
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL database, Auth, Storage) deployed on Zeabur

## Project Structure

```
FCU/
â”œâ”€â”€ PRD.md              # Product Requirements Document
â”œâ”€â”€ Learnify/           # macOS SwiftUI application (Xcode project)
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/           # Web frontend (currently empty)
â””â”€â”€ backend/            # Supabase configuration and edge functions
```

## Architecture

- **macOS Client**: SwiftUI app in `Learnify/` directory using supabase-swift SDK
- **Web Frontend**: Located in `frontend/` directory (currently empty)
- **Authentication**: Student ID-based auto-registration (no JWT required for check-ins)
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with simplified schema for auto-registration
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage for file uploads (screenshots)
- **Deployment**: Zeabur hosting platform

## Development Commands

### Backend (Express.js + TypeScript)
```bash
cd backend

# Local development with local Supabase
npm run dev:local

# Production development with remote Supabase  
npm run dev

# Supabase local management
npm run supabase:start    # Start local Supabase stack
npm run supabase:stop     # Stop local Supabase
npm run supabase:reset    # Reset local database

# Build and deployment
npm run build            # Build TypeScript
npm start               # Run production build
npm run type-check      # TypeScript validation
npm run lint            # Code linting
```

### macOS App (Learnify/)
- **Build**: Open `Learnify.xcodeproj` in Xcode and build (âŒ˜+B)
- **Run**: Run from Xcode (âŒ˜+R) or use `xcodebuild` command line
- **Test**: Run tests in Xcode (âŒ˜+U)

### Local Development URLs
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3000
- **Supabase Studio**: http://localhost:54323 (Database admin UI)
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:3000/health

### Current Implementation Status
- âœ… **Backend**: Complete check-in API with Supabase integration
- âœ… **Smart Quiz System**: Adaptive learning algorithm with SwiftUI questions
- âœ… **Local Dev**: Full local Supabase development stack
- âœ… **Deployment**: Zeabur deployment configuration ready
- âœ… **macOS app**: Native SwiftUI app with quiz integration
- âœ… **Web frontend**: React app with quiz functionality

## Key Features

1. **Auto-Registration**: Student ID-based check-ins with automatic student creation
2. **Smart Learning Quiz System**: Adaptive question selection based on learning patterns
3. **Gamification**: Daily check-ins, points system, leaderboards
4. **Submissions**: Screenshot uploads and GitHub repository linking
5. **Admin Dashboard**: Instructor view with class-wide analytics
6. **Awards System**: Instructor-awarded badges and recognition

### ðŸ§  Smart Learning Quiz System
**ðŸ“– [Complete Documentation](QUIZ_SYSTEM.md)**

Intelligent quiz system that ensures students master SwiftUI fundamentals through:
- **Adaptive Questions**: 60% incorrectly answered, 30% new, 10% reinforcement
- **Second Chances**: Students can retry questions until mastered
- **25 SwiftUI Questions**: Covering beginner to advanced concepts
- **Cross-Platform**: Web and iOS implementations with real-time sync
- **Performance Tracking**: Detailed analytics and progress monitoring

## Data Models

Core entities include:
- `students` - Student data with auto-registration support
- `student_check_ins` - Daily engagement tracking without cooldown restrictions
- `submissions` - Screenshots and GitHub links
- `quizzes/questions/quiz_attempts` - Assessment system
- `awards` - Recognition and badges
- `projects` - Information about student projects
- `project_submissions` - Links projects to students
- `project_votes` - Tracks student votes on projects
- `project_notes` - Notes and feedback on projects

## Development Notes

### Backend Development
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript for type safety
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with simplified schema (no auth.users dependency)
- **Authentication**: Student ID-based auto-registration (no JWT required)
- **Local Development**: Use `npm run dev:local` with local Supabase instance
- **Production**: Use `npm run dev` with remote Supabase cloud (loads `.env`)
- **API Testing**: Use Supabase Studio at http://localhost:54323 for database inspection
- **Migrations**: Database schema managed through Supabase migrations

### macOS App Development
- Use `supabase-swift` library for all backend interactions
- Student ID-based check-ins (no authentication tokens required)
- Follow SwiftUI best practices for macOS apps
- Integrate with auto-registration API endpoints

#### SwiftUI Modern API Guidelines
- **Navigation**: Use `NavigationStack` instead of `NavigationView` for iOS 16+
- **State Management**: Use `@Observable` macro and `Observation` framework instead of `ObservableObject` and `@Published`
- **Data Binding**: Use `@State` and `@Bindable` with Observable objects
- **Animations**: Prefer new animation APIs with `withAnimation` and `Animation` struct
- **Lists**: Use modern `List` APIs with `ForEach` and proper identifiers
- **Sheets/Presentations**: Use new presentation APIs like `sheet(item:)` and `fullScreenCover(item:)`
- **Minimum Deployment**: Target iOS 16+ / macOS 13+ for modern SwiftUI features

### Available Documentation
